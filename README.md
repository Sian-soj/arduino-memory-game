# 🎮 Arduino Memory Game

## 📌 Description
A memory-based game built using Arduino where LEDs blink in a random sequence and the user must repeat the sequence using push buttons.  
The sequence increases by one at each level, testing the user’s memory and reaction accuracy.

## ⚙️ Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- 4 LEDs  
- 4 Push Buttons  
- Resistors 4 x 220Ω
- Breadboard  
- Jumper Wires

## 🧠 Working Principle
1. Arduino generates a random LED sequence  
2. LEDs blink according to the generated sequence  
3. The user presses the buttons in the same order  
4. If the input is correct, the level increases  
5. If the input is incorrect, the game resets
